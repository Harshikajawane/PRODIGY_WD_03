# Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application

This is a simple web application that allows users to play the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Below, you'll find a brief overview of the project structure and functionality.

## File Structure

- **main.html**: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the web page, including the game board, winning message, and necessary elements. It also links to the stylesheet (style.css) and the JavaScript file (main.js).

- **style.css**: The stylesheet file that contains the styling rules for the game, such as the appearance of the cells, marks (X and O), and the winning message.

- **main.js**: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. It handles user interactions, checks for wins or draws, and updates the game state accordingly.

## HTML Structure

- The main HTML file (`main.html`) contains the structure of the web page. It includes a game board with cells, a winning message display, and a restart button.

## CSS Styling

- The stylesheet (`style.css`) defines the visual appearance of the game board, cells, marks, and winning message. It also includes styles for hover effects and the overall layout of the web page.

## JavaScript Logic

- The JavaScript file (`main.js`) implements the game logic. It includes constants for X and O classes, winning combinations, and functions to start the game, handle user clicks, check for wins or draws, and update the game state.

## How to Play

1. Open the `main.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click on any cell in the game board to place your mark (X or O).
3. The game alternates between X and O turns.
4. If a player wins or the game ends in a draw, a winning message is displayed.
5. Click the "RESTART" button to start a new game.
